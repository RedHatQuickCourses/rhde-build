<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Image Builder tool is a system service in RHEL, named <strong>osbuild-composer</strong>, with which you interact by means of the <strong>composer-cli</strong> command-line client or the <strong>Composer</strong> Cockpit module. It can generate various types of system images, including edge images.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[ figure of image builder service, its clients, input blueprint, and output images ]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Image Builder service in RHEL is not designed for remote clients, and it does not support creating system images, or <strong>composes</strong>, for operating systems different than the one it is running on. For example, you cannot use the Image Builder service from RHEL 9 to build a RHEL 8 nor a CentOS 9 Stream system image. Most likely, you will be running Image Builder in a VM and using SSH or Cockpit to interact with Image Builder on that VM.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You provide to Image Builder a blueprint using the <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML</a> syntax, which is very similar to INI files from Windows and Samba. A blueprint defines characteriscs of the system image, such as installed packages and enabled system services. It also enables customization of users, networking, and other system configurations, and not all of them are supported for edge images. You can think of a blueprint as a response file for the prompts and options you would get from the RHEL installation program, Anaconda.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An Image Builder blueprint should be independent of the target environment where you deploy the image. When you build a compose, Image Builder adds hardcoded customizations which depend on the image type. For example, if you build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), Image Builder enables the Cloud-Init service and also adds the AWS Systems Manager client. You could use the same blueprint to build different types of composes, for example ISO images to boot a physical system and Qcow2 images for OpenStack private clouds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest benefit of using Image Builder, compared to generic Anaconda or Ansible automation, is the built-in knowledge about the needs of different target platforms such as cloud providers and hypevisors. It ensures your image contains all recommended settings and system services for working whell on each platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All blueprints and composes are kept in the Image Builder service storage, and you must upload blueprints to build composes, download blueprints to make changes, and download composes so you can publish them somewhere suitable as a boot source for your physical or virtual systems. As a convenience, Image Builder can upload images by itself to a limited set of remote image stores. For example, it can take AWS API credentials as input and upload AMI images to AWS S3 so you can use them to create AWS EC2 instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the target environment and the type of image, you can use different methods to perform additional installation-time (or day-1) customization of those images, for example Anaconda Kickstart files and Cloud-init. Or you could build your own workflow for adding local customizations to an image, for example by using an interactive application which runs during the first boot.</p>

<h2 id="_edge_images_versus_package_based_systems"><a class="anchor" href="#_edge_images_versus_package_based_systems"></a>Edge Images Versus Package-based Systems</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regular compose types from Image Builder work the same as if you deploy RHEL from its installation media: they are package-based systems. After you install a physical system or boot a VM from these images, you manage it exactly the same way as if you installed the system from RHEL installation media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Edge compose types, in contrast, are image-based systems. They assume most customizations are predefined in the system image, and that software updates are performed by installing another system image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the scenario of updating a system to mitigate a CVE vulnerability with the Apache Web Server. You would act differently on image-based systemas compared to traditional package-based systems:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On regular RHEL, which is a package-based system, you would SSH into the system and use <code>dnf</code> to update the <code>httpd-server</code> package and its dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On RHEL for Edge, which is an image-based system, you would use Image Build to build a new system image that includes the updated <code>httpd-server</code> package and dependencies, and them deploy the new system image on the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installing and updating RHEL for Edge systems requires different approaches from the RHEL systems you are used to, while preserving compatibility with applications and hardware. You can develop and test applications using "regular RHEL" and later depeloy them in RHEL for Edge systems.</p>

<h2 id="_edge_images_and_rpm_ostree"><a class="anchor" href="#_edge_images_and_rpm_ostree"></a>Edge Images and RPM-OSTree</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Edge images from Image Builder are based on the OSTree technology, which configures the root filesystem as read-only. Well, not the true root file system, it&#8217;s actually a chroot, but you learn those details later in this course. In an OSTree-based system, you cannot change a system file, not even as root, except by deploying a new system image an rebooting into the new image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OSTree can keep multiple system images side-by-side in a system, so downloading updates does not affect a running system&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;constrast that with RPM package updates, which can alter files which are in use by running processes and produce unpredictable results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OSTree technology is not designed to be usable by itself, but to be infrastructure under higher-level Linux distribution tooling. In RHEL, the higher level infrastructure is RPM-OSTree, which builds OSTree system images from RPM packages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Image Builder users do not interact with the RPM-OSTree and OSTree tooling directly, at least not to build edge images. But they must interact with RPM-OSTree to distribute and apply updates to edge systems. [NOT TRUE]</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_edge_image_types"><a class="anchor" href="#_edge_image_types"></a>Edge Image Types</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only indispensable type of edge image (or edge compose) from Image Builder is the <strong>edge commit image</strong>. It provides an OSTree image, called a <strong>OSTree commit</strong>, as a single compressed archive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That OSTree commit can be pushed into an OSTree repository, and then consumed by a RHEL installation image, with a custom Kickstart file, to deploy into a physical system or virtual machine. This is a suggested workflow for developer testing and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use Image Builder to take an OSTree commit and build one of the following kinds of derived edge composes:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Edge installer images</dt>
<dd>
<p>They include a RHEL installer and an OSTree commit, so you can boot a physical system and install the system image, instead of using the RHEL installation media.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Edge cloud images</dt>
<dd>
<p>They are directly bootable by cloud or hypervisor platforms and include an already deployed OSTree commit.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both types of derived edge composes can install an edge system without network access to an OSTree repository, and you can use either the standard RHEL installation image or an edge installer image to install edge systems from network boot instead of booting from local media.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[ figure of RHEL ISO + remote OSTree commit and edge installer image with embeded OSTree commit ]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever the boot method and compose type you use for installing an edge system, it requires access to a remote OSTree repository to fetch and deploy system updates. Image Builder cannot build anyhing similar to an "edge update image", which would boot from local media or network boot and apply a system update. Such feature is currently in development, as part of the Red Hat In Veichle Operating System (RHIVOS), but it is not supported yet by Image Builder on RHEL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, all bootable types of edge composers supported by Image Builder are preconfigured with an OSTree remote, which points to an OSTree repository server, except for the <strong>edge container image</strong>. This is a special type of compose designed to run as a Linux container which serves an OSTree commit over HTTP. It is intended as a quick way for a developer to provision a remote OSTree repository to build and test edge installer images, but it is not designed for long term usage nor for serving system updates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this course, you will NOT use edge container composes, you will instead learn how to configure and manage remote OSTree repositories so you can provide system updates to edge devices.</p>

<h2 id="_naming_blueprints_and_composes"><a class="anchor" href="#_naming_blueprints_and_composes"></a>Naming Blueprints and Composes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Image Builder allows you to give human-readable names to blueprints, but it allways identifies images or composes using UUIDs. A compose refers to a specific build of a blueprint, so there could me multiple composes for the same blueprint. For example, you could build a new compose from an existing blueprint to create a new image with RPM package updates from RHEL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Image Builder maintains not only the image data for a compose, but also metadata such as package lists and build logs. Using the compose metadata, it is easy to compare two composes from the same blueprint and see what changed in the resulting image.</p>

<h2 id="_the_composer_cli_client"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_composer_cli_client"></a>The Composer CLI client</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>composer-cli</code> command provides the Image Builder command-line client. It sumbits requests to the Image Builder service through the <code>/run/weldr/api.socket</code> UNIX socket, wich is accessible to the <code>weldr</code> group. So, any user that is member of the <code>weldr</code> group can build RHEL for Edge images using the Image Builder service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general syntax of Image Builder CLI client commands consists of an <em>object</em> and a <em>verb</em>, where object is an entity mangaged by Image Builder, such as <code>blueprints</code>, <code>compose</code>, and <code>projects</code>, and verb is an action to perform on the entity or set of entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="dlist">

<p>The <code>compose</code> object is singular, while most other objects, such as <code>blueprints</code> and <code>projects</code>, are plural.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the following command lists all blueprints known to Image Builder:</p>

<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">$ <strong>composer-cli compose types</strong></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use the <code>--help</code> option with any object or verb, and you can also use the <code>help</code> command, so all the following are examples ways of getting online help from the Image Builder CLI:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-none hljs">$ <strong>composer-cli help</strong>
