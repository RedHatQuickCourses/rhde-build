# RHDE-1: Building Red Hat Device Edge Images

This course teaches how to create Red Hat Device Edge images for edge devices and kiosk computers. It is the starting point of a larger learning journey which targets RHEL for Edge and MicroShift. As more courses are released, we'll update this page with links to them.

Sample applications and configuration files are in the [rhder-build-samples](https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/tree/main) repository.

The course design docs are available to Red Hat employees only:

Figures on this course are designed using Google Slides, and the deck is available to Red Hat employees. Individual slides are exported to SVG files and cleaned using Inkscape. Those files are in the git repository.
