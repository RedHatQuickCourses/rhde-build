= Lab: Boot Test VMs from Remote OSTree Repositories

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Boot a test VM from an OSTree commit in a remote OSTree repository.

WARNING: Pending SME Review & Proofreading

== Before you Begin

You need a _development machine_ with RHEL and configured with the Image Builder service, its CLI and web UI, and a user that is a member of the `weldr` group. Make sure that your development machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-build:s4-install-lab.adoc[first lab].

You also need a _web server machine_ which serves an OSTree repository. Make sure that machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from xref:ch2-publish:s2-ostree-lab.adoc[a previous lab].

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.4 [tentative!] but should work with minimal or no change on newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course classroom, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`, and you start SSH sessions to the `servera` VM from the same user. If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment.

You will perform most steps in this lab alternating between your _development machine_ and your _web server machine_. You will also perform a few steps from a _test VM_ that you will create as part of this lab.

== Instructions

1. On your _development machine_, verify that you have the prerequisites from previous labs.

.. Verify that the Image Builder service is active and that the current Linux user can submit requests to it.

...
--

.. Check that you can get the current commit ID the OSTree branch with the httpd edge system image that you created in xref:ch2-publish:s2-ostree-lab.adoc[a previous lab]. You will get a different ID:
+

{commit-httpd-v1}
--
+
Pay attention to the final path element of the URL, which should be "edge".

2. On your _development machine_, install the Libvirtd tools and its Cockpit module, if they are not already installed.

.. Install the Libvirt, KVM, and Qemu daemons and tools. Alternativelly, install the "Virtualization Host" package group, which provides all those components.
+

$ *sudo dnf install qemu-kvm libvirt virt-install virt-viewer*

$ *sudo dnf install -y cockpit-machines*
...
Complete!
--

.. Grant an unprivileged user with permission to create and manage virtual machines (VMs).
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo groupmod libvirt -a -U student*

.. Log off and log in again to update the user membership of your unprivileged user and check that it can use libvirt's session interface.

3. On your _development machine_, create and publish a kickstart file which points to the OSTree repository on the web server.

.. Using your preferred text editor, create a file named `rhel9-httpd.ks` with the following contents:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
include::1@samples:ks:example$rhel9-httpd.ks[]
--
+
You can also download the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/blob/main/ks/rhel9-httpd.ks[kickstart file] from sample applications repository in GitHub.
+
Most lines on that kickstart file can be changed according to your needs, and real-world deployments would include items such as SSH keys for remote management. There are three really important pieces:
+
** The `autopart` command, which creates a disk partitioning scheme without using LVM. Else, your edge system would get a disk partitioning which is incompatible with RPM-OSTree and fail in a later installation stage.
** The `ostreesetup` command, which directs Anaconda to download the latest commit from a remote OSTree repository using HTTP.
** The `%post` block, which replaces the `user` directive in a regular kickstart file.  A `user` directive would work here but it would not for edge installer images.

.. Copy the Kickstart file to your home directory on the web server machine.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *scp rhel9-httpd.ks servera.lab.example.com:~*
...
--

4. Switch to your _web sever machine_ and publish the kickstart file in the web server content directory. This is simpler than embedding the kickstart file in the RHEL installation media or creating a virtual disk to use only for creating VMs.

.. Copy the kickstart file to the web server content directory.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
--
$ *ls -1*
{commit-httpd-v1}-commit.tar
rhel9-httpd.ks
$ *sudo cp rhel9-httpd.ks /var/www/html*
--

.. Ensure that the kickstart file is accessible to the `apache` user and has correct SELinux labels.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *ls -lZ /var/www/html*
total 5
drwxr-xr-x. 7 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 102 Sep  6 18:07 repo
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root unconfined_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 317 Sep  6 18:07 rhel9-httpd.ks
--

.. If you need, change file permissions and SELinux labels.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo chmod -R a+X /var/www/html*
$ *sudo restorecon -R /var/www/html*
--

5. Back to your _development machine_, verify that a remote client can access the kickstart file.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *curl http://servera.lab.example.com/rhel9-httpd.ks*
include::1@samples:ks:example$rhel9-httpd.ks[lines=1..3]
...
--

6. Still on your _development machine_, create a _test VM_ which boots from the RHEL installation ISO and fetches an edge commit image from a web server.

.. Download the standard https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/rhel[RHEL installation ISO] from the customer portal, from https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download#getredhatenterpriselinux7163[Red Hat Developers], or download a copy in the http://content.example.com/rhde/isos/[classroom server]. Choose either the Network Install Image or the RHEL Server ISO for a smaller download. You do *NOT* need an Offline Install Image.
+
Ensure you have a complete and consistent RHEL installation ISO in the `/home/student/Downloads/rhel-9.4-x86_64-boot.iso` file before proceeding.

.. Create a local VM, with a serial console and direct kernel loading, which uses the kickstart file from the previous steps.
+
The following is a long command, it is broken into multiple lines for readability. [ REVIEW for RHEL 9.4 ]
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *virt-install --name edge-test-1 --os-variant rhel9.5 \
--memory 2048 --vcpus 2 --disk size=10 --graphics=none \
--location /home/student/Downloads/rhel-9.5-x86_64-boot.iso \
--extra-arg inst.ks=http://servera.lab.example.com/rhel9-httpd.ks \
--extra-arg console=ttyS0 -v*
--
+
If you are used to managing Libvirt VMs using Cockpit, feel free to perform VM creation and other tasks using its web UI.
+
NOTE: You must use `--location` instead of `--cdrom` to be able to pass kernel arguments with `--extra-args`. Else you will be required to use the Grub menu, interactively, to add a reference to the kickstart file.

.. Wait until the installation finishes and you get a login prompt on the VM. It is expected that the VM reboots once during its installation. Log in as user `core` with password `redhat123`.

7. On your _test VM_, check it is an image-based system using RPM-OStree.

.. Use the `rpm-ostree` command to see its deployed branch and commit.

                   Commit: {commit-httpd-v1}
--
+
Notice that the commit ID you see matches the one from the `curl` command at the beginning of this lab.

.. You can get similar information from the `ostree` command, using its default system repository.

--

.. Also, notice that the local OSTree repository connects to a remote repository on the web server machine.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
[core@edge ~]$ *ostree remote list --show-urls*
edge  http://servera.lab.example.com/repo/
--

.. Check also the location of the local OSTree repository in `/sysroot`
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ ostree refs --repo=/sysroot/ostree/repo
ostree/0/1/0

/dev/vda1 on /boot type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)
--

8. On the _test VM_, verify that there is an Apache Web Server running.

.. Check that the `httpd` Systemd service is enabled and active
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
[core@edge ~]$ *systemctl is-active httpd*
active
--

.. Check that the Apache Web Server inside the VM returns the standard welcome page from RHEL.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
[core@edge ~]$ *curl 127.0.0.1*
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">

        <head>
                <title>Test Page for the HTTP Server on Red Hat Enterprise Linux</title>
...
--

9. Return to your _developer machine_, and optionally stop your _test VM_.
+
WARNING: Do not delete (undefine) your _test VM_, you will use it during the next chapter to perform system updates.

.. Detach from the serial console of the VM by typing kbd:[Ctrl+\]].
+
Later you can reattach a VM serial console using the `virsh console` command.

.. Optionally, stop the _test VM_. You will still use that VM in a future lab, when we apply updates to edge images.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *virsh destroy edge-test-1*
Domain 'edge-test-1' destroyed
$ *virsh list --all*
 Id   Name          State
---------------------------
 1    edge-test-1   shut-off
--
+
NOTE: The `destroy` verb of the `virsh` command does not actually "destroys" a VM. It only stops the VM, which can be restarted at any time with the `virsh start` command. What it actually destroys is the running kernel process which contains the running VM.

.. If the VM creation fails, which could be caused by an incorrect kickstart file, stop and delete the VM before retrying the previous step.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *virsh destroy edge-test-1*
Domain 'edge-test-1' destroyed
$ *virsh undefine --remove-all-storage edge-test-1*
Domain 'edge-test-1' has been undefined
--

You just learned how to create and check a local VM from an edge commit image that was published in a remote OSTree repository.

== Next Steps

The next activity builds an edge installer image and boots another local VM from it, demonstrating another method to provision edge devices.
