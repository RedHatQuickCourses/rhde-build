Validate RHEL for Edge images by deploying them in local VMs

WARNING: Pending SME Review & Proofreading

== Introduction

This chapter explains the use of KVM virtualization from RHEL to test edge device images, as part of a development or CI/CD workflow, and the usage scenarios for different kinds of edge installer images.

This chapter presents a series of hands-on activities that provision VMs from OSTree repositories, either directly, by using the standard RHEL installation media, or by means of an edge installer image generated by Image Builder. The next and final chapter shows how to apply updates to VMs provisioned using either method.
