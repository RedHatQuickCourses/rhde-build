= Test Operating System Images for Edge Devices

Goal:: 
Validate RHEL for Edge images by deploying them in local VMs

WARNING: Work In Progress

== Introduction

This chapter explains how to use KVM virtualization from RHEL to test edge device images, as part of a development or CI/CD workflow.

This chapter presents a series of hands-on activities which provision VMs from OSTree repositories, either directly, by using the standard RHEL installation media, or by means of an edge installer image generated by Image Builder. The next and final chapter shows how to apply update to VMs provisioned using either method.
