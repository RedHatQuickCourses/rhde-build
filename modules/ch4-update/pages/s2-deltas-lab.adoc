= Lab: Create And Publish Edge Image Updates

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Build RHEL for Edge image updates and publish them as OSTree deltas.

WARNING: Work in Progress

== Before you Begin

You need a _development machine_ with RHEL and configured with the Image Builder service, its CLI and web UI, and a user that is member of the `weldr` group. Make sure your development machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-build:s4-install-lab.adoc[first lab].

You also need a _web server machine_ which serves an OSTree repository. Make sure that machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from xref:ch2-publish:s2-ostree-lab.adoc[a previous lab].

Finally, you need the _test VM_ that you created and published in xref:ch2-publish:s2-boot-lab.adoc[another lab].

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.4 [tentative!] but should work with minimal or no change on and newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course classroom, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`, and you start SSH sessions to the `servera` VM from the same user. In this case, the `workstation` VM is your _development machine_, and the `servera` VM is your _web server_ machine. If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment. 

[ REVIEW NEXT PARA ]

You will some steps in this lab on your _development machine_ and some steps on the _web server_ machine.

[ Make one lab perform an update without a delta, and the other with a delta? ]

== Instructions

1. On your _development machine_, verify that you have the prerequisites from previous labs.

.. Verify that the Image Builder service is active and that the current Linux user can submit requests to it.

    Build:              NEVRA:osbuild-composer-76-2.el9_2.x86_64
...
--

.. Check that a remote client can access the OSTree repository in the web server machine.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *curl http://servera.lab.example.com/repo/config*
[core]
repo_version=1
mode=archive-z2
--

.. Check that you can get the current commit ID the OSTree branch with the httpd edge system image that you created in xref:ch2-publish:s3-ostree-lab.adoc[a previous lab]. Your will get a different ID:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *curl http://servera.lab.example.com/repo/refs/heads/rhel/9/x86_64/edge*
4afeda6a96ec8b2c263b6965a9c3f92db1db2436ae1e1233da70b7776fc6137b
--
+
Pay attention to the final path element of the URL, which should be "edge".

.. Check that you can manage local VMs, and there's a VM left from the xref:s2-boot-lab:[previous lab] named `edge-test-1`.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *virsh list --all*
 Id   Name          State
---------------------------
 1    edge-test-1   shut-off
 2    edge-db-1     shut-off
---
+
It's fine the existing VM displays an status of "running" instead of "shut off".

2. Make changes to the edge image blueprint to add a custom welcome page to the Apache Web Server.

.. Open the `rhel9-httpd.toml` file which you created in a xref:ch1-build-blueprint-lab.adoc[previous lab], with any text editor.

.. Increment the version number, in tbe beginning of the TOML file, and add a `customizations.file` section with an inline HTML page, to the end of the TOML file.
+

mode = "0644"
user = "root"
group = "root"
data = """
<html>
<body>
<h1>I am an Edge Device!</h1>
</body>
</html>
"""--

.. Push the updated blueprint.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli push blueprints rhde-build-samples/blueprints/rhel9-httpd-v2.toml*
--

.. Verify that the blueprint in the Image Builder service contains your changes.

rhel9-mysql
$ *composer-cli blueprints show rhel9-edge*
name = "rhel9-edge"
description = "blueprint-rhel9-edge"
version = "0.0.2"
...
--

3. Still on your _development machine_, build an edge commit image from your changed blueprint.

.. Start a compose for an edge commit image and copy its UUID to a shell variable.
+
[ do I need a parent? looks like I have to reference the external repo ]
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose start-ostree rhel9-edge edge-commit --url http://servera.lab.example.com/repo --ref rhel/9/x86_64/edge*
Compose fb5ef664-1def-4589-919d-1a0681f86371 added to the queue
$ *UUID=fb5ef664-1def-4589-919d-1a0681f86371*
--

.. Wait until the compose finishes. To avoid clutter from previous labs, this time we filter the list of composes.
+
[ try a better filter with jq. why can't I ask just the status of a given compose? :-() ]
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose list running*

--

.. Download the edge commit image and copy it to your _web sever machine_.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose image $UUID*
fb5ef664-1def-4589-919d-1a0681f86371-commit.tar
$ *scp $UUID-commit.tar servera:~*
...
--

4. On your _web server machine_, copy the new edge image to the OSTree repository.

.. Copy the shell variable with the UUID of the new edge commit image and check that it exists on your home folder.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *UUID=fb5ef664-1def-4589-919d-1a0681f86371*
$ *ls $UUID-commit.tar*
fb5ef664-1def-4589-919d-1a0681f86371-commit.tar
--

.. Extract the edge commit image and pull it into the OSTree repository.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *mkdir delete-me*
$ *tar xf $UUID-commit.tar -C delete-me/*
$ *sudo ostree pull-local --repo=/var/www/html/repo delete-me/repo*
506 metadata, 1893 content objects imported; 0 bytes content written
--

.. Verify that the OSTree repo contains the same branch than your new edge commit image. The OSTree repo should contain additional branches.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *ostree refs --repo=delete-me/repo*
rhel/9/x86_64/edge
$ *ostree refs --repo=/var/www/html/repo*
rhel/9/x86_64/edge
rhel/9/x86_64/db
--

.. Verify that the OSTree repo contains the same commit than your new edge commit image.
+
[ looks like my pull overwrote everything in the branch with the new commit and discarded the old one :-( ]
+
[ do I fix this at build time or at pull time? looks like at build time ]
+
[ parent must be 4afeda6a96ec8b2c263b6965a9c3f92db1db2436ae1e1233da70b7776fc6137b for consistency with previous labs ]

[ with the edge-db VM, you need to configure a remote before applying updates ]

[ there's rpm-ostree update, to get a newer commit of the same branch, and rpm-ostree rebase, to switch to a different branch which uses a different RHEL release ]


[ to make a lab using the edge-db VM more interesting (instead of 90%+ the same as this) could configure automatic image updates
But then we'd miss automatic rollbacks (greenboot) which I didn't put in scope here, this course is already too long

[ After an update, grub shows two entries (new and old deployment) show it here or in the next lab with the db VM? ]

[ should I start with an empty remote ostree repo and reference it since the first build? The way it is now, the first build is different than other builds. ]

[ Use --filename to not have to deal with UUIDs? ]
