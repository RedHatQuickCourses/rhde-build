= Publish Operating System Images for Edge Devices

Goal:: 
Publish RHEL for Edge images on remote OSTree repositories.

== Introduction

This chapter introduces OSTree repository management and OSTree concepts such as commits and remotes.

After explaining these concepts, this chapter presents a series of hands-on activities that configure a web server to provide OSTree repositories and publish edge commit images from Image Builder on those repositories. The next chapters use those OSTree repositories to provision devices in edge locations, and deliver updates to edge devices.
