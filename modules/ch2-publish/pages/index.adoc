== Introduction

This chapter introduces OSTree repository management and OSTree concepts such as commits and remotes.

After explaining these concepts, this chapter presents a series of hands-on activities which configure a web server to provide OSTree repositories and publish edge commmit images from Image Builder on those repositories. The next chapters use those OSTree repositories to provision devices in edge locations, and delivering updates to edge devices.
