= Lab: Install Image Builder on a Development Machine

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Install and configure Image Builder in a RHEL machine for creating edge images.

== Before you Begin

You need a _development machine_ running RHEL, to which you have unrestricted sudo rights and also access to RHEL package repositories. That machine must have plenty of disk space to store multiple OSTree commits and also to use as scratch space for downloading RPM packages and bootable installation images.

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.5 but should work with minimal or no change on and newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course classroom, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student` and grant that same user access to the Image Builder service. If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment.

== Instructions

1. Install the packages for the Image Builder service and its clients on your development machine.

.. Install the RPM packages for the Image Builder service and its CLI.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo dnf install osbuild-composer composer-cli*
...
Complete!
--

.. Install the RPM packages for the Cockpit service and its Composer module.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo dnf install cockpit-composer*
...
Complete!
--

2. Enable the Image Builder and Cockpit services.

.. Enable and activate the Image Builder service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo systemctl enable osbuild-composer.socket --now*
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/osbuild-composer.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/osbuild-composer.socket.
--

.. Enable and activate the Cockpit service, if not already enabled on your development machine.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now*
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/cockpit.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.
--

.. Enable remote access to the Cockpit service, if not already enabled on your development machine.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=cockpit --permanent*
success
$ *sudo firewall-cmd --reload*
success
--

3. Grant an unprivileged user access to Image Builder.

.. Add the `student` user to the `weldr` group so it can submit requests to the Image Builder service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo usermod -a -G weldr student*
--

.. Configure the user with bash command autocompletion for the Image Builder CLI.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *echo 'source /etc/bash_completion.d/composer-cli' >> $HOME/.bashrc*
--

4. Verify that an unprivileged user can access Image Builder using its CLI.

.. Log out and log in again, then verify that the `student` belongs to the `weldr` group.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *id*
uid=1000(student) gid=1000(student) groups=1000(student),10(wheel),972(weldr) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
--

.. Verify that autocompletion works for the Image Builder CLI by pressing kbd:[Tab] twice.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes,macros"]
--
$ *composer-cli kbd:[Tab]kbd:[Tab]*
blueprints  compose     distros     help        modules     projects    sources     upload
--

.. List image types known to the Image Builder service. The list varies depending on the RHEL release, but notice there are many "edge" image types.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose types*
ami
edge-commit
edge-container
edge-installer
edge-raw-image
edge-simplified-installer
gce
...
--

.. If your user is not a member of the `weldr` group, or you forgot to log off and log in again, you will see a permission error message:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose types*
ERROR: Types Error: you do not have permission to access /run/weldr/api.socket.  Check to make sure that you are a member of the weldr group
--

5. Verify that an unprivileged user can access the Image Builder service from Cockpit.

.. Open a web browser and go to \https://127.0.0.1:9090. Accept the insecure TLS certificate from Cockpit, if you need, and log in as the same unprivileged user that you configured in previous steps.

.. After you log in, click btn:[Image Builder] to the left to enter the Image Builder web UI.
+

.. If your user is not a member of the `weldr` group, you will see a misleading error message stating that the Image Builder service was not started.

6. Configure Image Builder to access package repositories from the local network.
+
This step is not always required, because Image Builder will download RPM packages from the Red Hat Customer Portal, but it may be necessary depending on your organization's policies. If you have local mirrors of RHEL package repositories, it is best to use then for faster image builds and to conserve internet bandwidth.

.. Create a directory to store your repository overrides.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo mkdir -p /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories*
--

.. Copy the example configuration file for your distribution from the `/usr/share/osbuild-composer/` directory.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo cp /usr/share/osbuild-composer/repositories/rhel-9.5.json /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories/*
--

.. Modify the configuration file to match your local DNF repository. Pay attention to attributes such as `baseurl`, `rhsm` and `check_gpg`.
+
In the classroom environment, you should make the following edits:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
...
include::1@samples:repos:example$rhel-9.5.json[lines=50..53]
...
include::1@samples:repos:example$rhel-9.5.json[lines=55..56]
...
include::1@samples:repos:example$rhel-9.5.json[lines=58..60]
...
include::1@samples:repos:example$rhel-9.5.json[lines=62..63]
...
--
+
You can download a https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/blob/main/repositories/rhel-9.5.json[configuration file] with all changes done from the sample applications repository in GitHub.

.. Restart the Image Builder service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo systemctl stop osbuild-worker@1.service*
$ *sudo systemctl restart osbuild-composer*
--
+
IMPORTANT: Restarting Image Builder this way  only works because there was no attempt at building any image, so there should be only one active `osbuild-worker@<number>` service. If there were more, it would be necessary to either stop all of them or reboot your _developer machine_.

7. Check that the Image Builder service is using your RHEL repository overides.

.. Verify that the repository overrides are in effect, using the Image Builder CLI.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli sources list*
appstream
baseos
$ *composer-cli sources info baseos*
check_gpg = false
check_repogpg = false
...
rhsm = false
system = true
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "http://content.example.com/rhel9.5/x86_64/dvd/BaseOS"
$ *composer-cli sources info appstream*
check_gpg = false
check_repogpg = false
...
rhsm = false
system = true
type = "yum-baseurl"
url = "http://content.example.com/rhel9.5/x86_64/dvd/ApStream"
--

.. You cannot configure repository overrides for RHEL packages using the Image Builder web UI but you can verify that the changes are in effect.
+
Enter the btn:[Image Builder] item in Cockpit and click btn:[Sources]. Then, for both the btn:[BaseOS] and the btn:[AppStreams] channels, click btn:[>] to expand the URL and verify it matches your configuration override.
+
TODO update screen shot
+
image::s4-cockpit-repository-url.png[]
+
If you have Cockpit open in your web browser, you must reload the web page to see the changes.

8. Add the JQ command-line JSON processor, because it's useful for scripting Image Builder tasks.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo dnf install -y jq*
...
Complete!
--

9. Verify that you have the RPM-OStree and OSTree tools, which were installed as dependencies from image Builder. You may see different versions than the following output, depending on your RHEL release and package updates.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *rpm-ostree --version*
rpm-ostree:
 Version: '2024.7'
...
$ *ostree --version*
libostree:
 Version: '2024.7'
...
--

Now your test system should be fully configured to build edge image using the Image Builder service.
