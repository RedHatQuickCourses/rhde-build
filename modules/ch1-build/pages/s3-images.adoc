== The RHEL Image Builder Service

[ Maybe break this entire presentation into multiple lectures and interleave them with the labs ]

[ Add something on why it needs to be a system service and why it's secure (unlike docker)]

[ Use figure from slide #24 https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h9eEpeSgUTAWVxi3gSjbereypMQEuoTE3I5dPtY_DeQ/edit#slide=id.g2c32966f6af_0_1664 ]

The Image Builder tool is a system service in RHEL, named *osbuild-composer*, with which you interact by means of the *composer-cli* command-line client or the *Composer* Cockpit module. It can generate various types of system images, including edge images.

[ figure of image builder service, its clients, input blueprint, and output images ]

The Image Builder service in RHEL is not designed for remote clients, and it does not support creating system images, or *composes*, for operating systems different than the one it is running on. For example, you cannot use the Image Builder service from RHEL 9 to build a RHEL 8 nor a CentOS 9 Stream system image. Most likely, you will be running Image Builder in a VM and using SSH or Cockpit to interact with Image Builder on that VM.

You provide to Image Builder a blueprint using the https://toml.io/en/[TOML] syntax, which is very similar to INI files from Windows and Samba. A blueprint defines characteriscs of the system image, such as installed packages and enabled system services. It also enables customization of users, networking, and other system configurations, and not all of them are supported for edge images. You can think of a blueprint as a response file for the prompts and options you would get from the RHEL installation program, Anaconda.

An Image Builder blueprint should be independent of the target environment where you deploy the image. When you build a compose, Image Builder adds hardcoded customizations which depend on the image type. For example, if you build an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), Image Builder enables the Cloud-Init service and also adds the AWS Systems Manager client. You could use the same blueprint to build different types of composes, for example ISO images to boot a physical system and Qcow2 images for OpenStack private clouds.

The biggest benefit of using Image Builder, compared to generic Anaconda or Ansible automation, is the built-in knowledge about the needs of different target platforms such as cloud providers and hypevisors. It ensures your image contains all recommended settings and system services for working whell on each platform.

All blueprints and composes are kept in the Image Builder service storage, and you must upload blueprints to build composes, download blueprints to make changes, and download composes so you can publish them somewhere suitable as a boot source for your physical or virtual systems. As a convenience, Image Builder can upload images by itself to a limited set of remote image stores. For example, it can take AWS API credentials as input and upload AMI images to AWS S3 so you can use them to create AWS EC2 instances.

Depending on the target environment and the type of image, you can use different methods to perform additional installation-time (or day-1) customization of those images, for example Anaconda Kickstart files and Cloud-init. Or you could build your own workflow for adding local customizations to an image, for example by using an interactive application which runs during the first boot.

== Edge Images Versus Package-based Systems

Regular compose types from Image Builder work the same as if you deploy RHEL from its installation media: they are package-based systems. After you install a physical system or boot a VM from these images, you manage it exactly the same way as if you installed the system from RHEL installation media.

Edge compose types, in contrast, are image-based systems. They assume most customizations are predefined in the system image, and that software updates are performed by installing another system image.

Consider the scenario of updating a system to mitigate a CVE vulnerability with the Apache Web Server. You would act differently on image-based systemas compared to traditional package-based systems:

* On regular RHEL, which is a package-based system, you would SSH into the system and use `dnf` to update the `httpd-server` package and its dependencies.

* On RHEL for Edge, which is an image-based system, you would use Image Build to build a new system image that includes the updated `httpd-server` package and dependencies, and them deploy the new system image on the system.

Installing and updating RHEL for Edge systems requires different approaches from the RHEL systems you are used to, while preserving compatibility with applications and hardware. You can develop and test applications using "regular RHEL" and later depeloy them in RHEL for Edge systems. 

== Edge Images and RPM-OSTree

Edge images from Image Builder are based on the OSTree technology, which configures the root filesystem as read-only. Well, not the true root file system, it's actually a chroot, but you learn those details later in this course. In an OSTree-based system, you cannot change a system file, not even as root, except by deploying a new system image an rebooting into the new image.

OSTree can keep multiple system images side-by-side in a system, so downloading updates does not affect a running system -- constrast that with RPM package updates, which can alter files which are in use by running processes and produce unpredictable results.

The OSTree technology is not designed to be usable by itself, but to be infrastructure under higher-level Linux distribution tooling. In RHEL, the higher level infrastructure is RPM-OSTree, which builds OSTree system images from RPM packages.

Image Builder users do not interact with the RPM-OSTree and OSTree tooling directly, at least not to build edge images. But they must interact with RPM-OSTree to distribute and apply updates to edge systems. [NOT TRUE]

== Edge Image Types

The only indispensable type of edge image (or edge compose) from Image Builder is the *edge commit image*. It provides an OSTree image, called a *OSTree commit*, as a single compressed archive.

That OSTree commit can be pushed into an OSTree repository, and then consumed by a RHEL installation image, with a custom Kickstart file, to deploy into a physical system or virtual machine. This is a suggested workflow for developer testing and CI/CD pipelines.

You can also use Image Builder to take an OSTree commit and build one of the following kinds of derived edge composes:

Edge installer images::

They include a RHEL installer and an OSTree commit, so you can boot a physical system and install the system image, instead of using the RHEL installation media.

Edge cloud images::

They are directly bootable by cloud or hypervisor platforms and include an already deployed OSTree commit.

Both types of derived edge composes can install an edge system without network access to an OSTree repository, and you can use either the standard RHEL installation image or an edge installer image to install edge systems from network boot instead of booting from local media.

[ figure of RHEL ISO + remote OSTree commit and edge installer image with embeded OSTree commit ]

Whatever the boot method and compose type you use for installing an edge system, it requires access to a remote OSTree repository to fetch and deploy system updates. Image Builder cannot build anyhing similar to an "edge update image", which would boot from local media or network boot and apply a system update. Such feature is currently in development, as part of the Red Hat In Veichle Operating System (RHIVOS), but it is not supported yet by Image Builder on RHEL.

In fact, all bootable types of edge composers supported by Image Builder are preconfigured with an OSTree remote, which points to an OSTree repository server, except for the *edge container image*. This is a special type of compose designed to run as a Linux container which serves an OSTree commit over HTTP. It is intended as a quick way for a developer to provision a remote OSTree repository to build and test edge installer images, but it is not designed for long term usage nor for serving system updates.

In this course, you will NOT use edge container composes, you will instead learn how to configure and manage remote OSTree repositories so you can provide system updates to edge devices.

== Naming Blueprints and Composes

Image Builder allows you to give human-readable names to blueprints, but it allways identifies images or composes using UUIDs. A compose refers to a specific build of a blueprint, so there could me multiple composes for the same blueprint. For example, you could build a new compose from an existing blueprint to create a new image with RPM package updates from RHEL.

Image Builder maintains not only the image data for a compose, but also metadata such as package lists and build logs. Using the compose metadata, it is easy to compare two composes from the same blueprint and see what changed in the resulting image.

[ Need more -- concepts. docs/upstream links, or maybe just more highlight as heading or def lists -- to blueprints and composes. Trying to postpone details to RHDE-2-4 ]

== The Composer CLI client

The `composer-cli` command provides the Image Builder command-line client. It sumbits requests to the Image Builder service through the `/run/weldr/api.socket` UNIX socket, wich is accessible to the `weldr` group. So, any user that is member of the `weldr` group can build RHEL for Edge images using the Image Builder service.

The general syntax of Image Builder CLI client commands consists of an _object_ and a _verb_, where object is an entity mangaged by Image Builder, such as `blueprints`, `compose`, and `projects`, and verb is an action to perform on the entity or set of entities.

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
composer-cli _object_ _verb_ [_options_] [_arguments_]
--

Not all commands start with an object, sometimes there's just a verb.

NOTE:: The `compose` object is singular, while most other objects, such as `blueprints` and `projects`, are plural.

For example, the following command lists all blueprints known to Image Builder:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli blueprints list*
--

And the following command lists the types of composes that Image Builder recognizes:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose types*
--

You can use the `--help` option with any object or verb, and you can also use the `help` command, so all the following are examples ways of getting online help from the Image Builder CLI:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli help*
$ *composer-cli --help*
$ *composer-cli help blueprints*
$ *composer-cli blueprints --help*
$ *composer-cli help blueprints list*
$ *composer-cli blueprints list --help*
--

Take your time to study the on-line help of the Image Builder CLI. There are some operations there which are not available from the Cockpit module.

== The Composer Cockplit Module

The Composer Cockpit module provives the Image Builder web user interface. It adds an *Image Builder* item to the left navigation pane of the Cockpit user interface with three tabs:

Blueprints::

Manages blueprints and creates images from blueprints.

Images::

Manages images and access the build logs from creating an image.

Sources::

Manages package repositories used to download RPM packages from RHEL and third-party applications.

Notice that the Image Builder CLI uses the `compose` command to refer to images, while the Image Builder web UI uses the term "image" to refer to composes.

Notice that the Image Builder web UI is designed for large monitors and requires wide horizontal resolution, else headings and data may be truncated in the images page.


== Next Steps

Now that you was introduced to the essential concepts of RHEL for Edge, a series of hands-on activties install and configure Image Builder in a test system and build simple edge images. Later in this course you will publish those images in a web server, test those edge images using local VMs, and them update those VMs to use new system images.
