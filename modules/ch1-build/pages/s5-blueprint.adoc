== Image Builder Blueprints and Composes

Creating a blueprint is the first step in the process of building an edge system image, which can be published into an OSTree repository, and optionally embeded into installation media to provision edge devices.

Before detailing the structure and usage of blueprints, we must understanbd a few concepts about Image Builder, in special the concepts of blueprints and composes.

You provide to Image Builder a _blueprint_ that defines characteriscs of the system image, such as installed packages and enabled system services. It also defines customizations such as predefined users, enabled sytem services, and open firewall ports. You can think of a blueprint as a response file for the prompts and options you would get from the RHEL installation program, Anaconda.

Using blueprint as input, Image Builder runs a _compose_, which is a job that produces a system image. You can build different types of images from the same blueprint. And you can build multiple instances of images of the same type, from the same blueprint, to include recent package updates. A compose enables you to access the end result, that is, the image raw data, and other information such as build logs and the exact versions of packages included in a compose.

All blueprints and composes are kept in the Image Builder service storage, and you must upload blueprints to create composes, download blueprints to make changes, and download composes so you can publish them somewhere suitable as a boot source for your physical or virtual edge systems.

As a convenience, Image Builder can upload images by itself to a limited set of remote image stores. For example, it can take AWS API credentials as input and upload AMI images to AWS S3 so you can use them to create AWS EC2 instances.

The remaining of this section focuses on blueprints, and the next section focuses on composes.

== Using Blueprints with Image Builder

A Blueprint is a text file using the https://toml.io/en/[TOML] syntax, which is very similar to INI files from Windows and Samba. The TOML syntax was designed for ease of processing by code and ease of converting to and from JSON. Keys in a TOML file can be composed of dot notation, supporting nested attributes, and multiple sections of same name are grouped in arrays.

You upload the TOML file to the Image Builder service, and the copy in Image Builder storage serves as input for composes. If you change a blueprint file, you must upload the changed file to Image Builder to be able to run new composes with the changes.

Once you upload (or push) a blueprint to Image Builder, it's file name is fogotten. You must refer to the blueprint by its `name` attribute.

== Introduction to Blueprint Syntax

A blueprint starts with a few metadata attributes, which specify the name, version, and provide a description of the blueprint itself. These attributes are simple `name = value` pairs, for example:

[source,subs="verbatim"]
--
name = "test-blueprint"
description = "My first test blueprint for RHEL Image Builder"
version = "1.0.0"
distro = "rhel-92"
--

The `distro` attribute enables using a newer RHEL release to build images using kernels and packages from older RHEL releases, for example using a RHEL 9.4 machine to build a RHEL 9.2 image. You can use the image Builder service from a RHEL 9 machine to build a RHEL 8 image, if you need.

Sections named with double square brackets, such as `+[[section]]+`, enable listing packages, package groups, and container images to include in the image, for example:

[source,subs="verbatim"]
--
[[packages]]
name = "httpd"
version= "2.4.*"

[[packages]]
name = "mysql"
version= "8.0.*"

[[packages]]
name = "mysql-server"
version= "8.0.*"
--

Notice that you can have multiple sections of the same name and you can use UNIX glob syntax to specifi a partial version number for packages.

Finally, you can provide a number of customizations, that specicy system settings such as predefined users, firewall settings, and SSH keys, for example:

[source,subs="verbatim"]
--
[customizations.firewall]
ports = ["22:tcp", "80:tcp"]

[customizations.services]
enabled = ["sshd", "cockpit.socket", "httpd"]
--

Notice that not all customizations are valid for all types of composes. Also, when you build derived images, such as an edger installer image, it does not make sense to specify packages and package groups, because these are already provided by a pre-existing edge image and its OSTree commit.

You can review more details about blueprint syntax in the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_a_customized_rhel_system_image/creating-system-images-with-composer-command-line-interface_composing-a-customized-rhel-system-image#composer-blueprint-format_creating-system-images-with-composer-command-line-interface[RHEL product documentation] and the https://osbuild.org/docs/user-guide/blueprint-reference/[upstream documentation] of Image Builder. The https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/composing_installing_and_managing_rhel_for_edge_images/composing-a-rhel-for-edge-image-using-image-builder-command-line_composing-installing-managing-rhel-for-edge-images#image-customizations_composing-a-rhel-for-edge-image-using-image-builder-command-line[RHEL for Edge product documentation] describes which customizations are valid for edge composes.

== The Composer CLI client

The `composer-cli` command provides the Image Builder command-line client. It sumbits requests to the Image Builder service through the `/run/weldr/api.socket` UNIX socket, wich is accessible to the `weldr` group. So, any user that is member of the `weldr` group can build RHEL for Edge images using the Image Builder service.

The general syntax of Image Builder CLI client commands consists of an _object_ and a _verb_, where object is an entity mangaged by Image Builder, such as `blueprints`, `compose`, and `projects`, and verb is an action to perform on the entity or set of entities.

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
composer-cli _object_ _verb_ [_options_] [_arguments_]
--

Not all commands start with an object, sometimes there's just a verb.

NOTE:: The `compose` object is singular, while most other objects, such as `blueprints` and `projects`, are plural.

For example, the following command lists all blueprints known to Image Builder:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli blueprints list*
--

And the following command lists the types of composes that Image Builder recognizes:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli compose types*
--

You can use the `--help` option with any object or verb, and you can also use the `help` command, so all the following are examples ways of getting online help from the Image Builder CLI:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *composer-cli help*
$ *composer-cli --help*
$ *composer-cli help blueprints*
$ *composer-cli blueprints --help*
$ *composer-cli help blueprints list*
$ *composer-cli blueprints list --help*
--

Take your time to study the on-line help of the Image Builder CLI. There are some operations there which are not available from the Cockpit module.

== The Composer Cockplit Module

The Composer Cockpit module provives the Image Builder web user interface. It adds an *Image Builder* item to the left navigation pane of the Cockpit user interface with three tabs:

Blueprints::

Manages blueprints and creates images from blueprints.

Images::

Manages images and access the build logs from creating an image.

Sources::

Manages package repositories used to download RPM packages from RHEL and third-party applications.

Notice that the Image Builder CLI uses the `compose` command to refer to images, while the Image Builder web UI uses the term "image" to refer to composes.

Notice that the Image Builder web UI is designed for large monitors and requires wide horizontal resolution, else headings and data may be truncated in the images page.

== Next Steps

Now that you know the Image Builder blueprint syntax and its client tools, you can create, push, and validate a blueprint that you will, later in this course, use to generate images to provision and update edge devices.
