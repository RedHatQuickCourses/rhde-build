= Introduction to Red Hat Device Edge

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Understand how edge devices differ from traditional Linux servers and the features of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for Edge.

== What is Red Hat Device Edge

Red Hat Device Edge is a software and support subscription that bundles three components:

. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), which includes a feature set known as *RHEL for Edge*.
. Red Hat build of MicroShift.
. Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform.

All of these three components can be purchased as part of a number of other subscriptions from Red Hat. For example, RHEL and Ansible are frequently purchased as their own subscriptions, instead of as part of a bundle, and MicroShift is also available as part of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and Red Hat OpenShift Plus.

In the end, you may purchase Red Hat Device Edge to use the RHEL for Edge feature in an army of small edge devices, but you could also find out that your edge machines are "large" and best suited to another subscription which also includes RHEL, OpenShift, and other Red Hat products, and still take advantage of the RHEL for Edge feature. You could also mix entitlements from different subscriptions, for example, some from RHEL for Edge and others from regular RHEL, on the same edge site that contains multiple kinds of machines.

In this course, we focus on the technical capabilities provided by RHEL for Edge, while other courses in this learning path focus on MicroShift and Ansible management of edge devices.

== What is RHEL for Edge

RHEL for Edge offers a number of technical capabilities designed to make it more productive and cost-effective to provision and manage a larger fleet of edge devices, compared to a relatively smaller fleet of office workstations and corporate servers. These capabilities also address the common constraints on the availability of good network connectivity and highly skilled IT personnel at edge sites.

The RHEL for Edge feature relies on the following components of Red Hat Enterprise Linux:

Image Builder::

The Image builder tool takes a blueprint as input and outputs different types of operating system images. Those images can be either traditional package-based images or single-system images, which it calls edge images, and those images can be deployed by means of physical media, network boot, or as cloud provider native images.

OSTree::

The OSTree technology enables deploying and updating bootable operating system images as atomic units, with efficient use of both disk space and network bandwidth. OSTree is also capable of preserving the local state of a device, including both operating system configuration and application data, when updating a system image.

RPM-OSTree::

The RPM-ostree technology is a bridge between the world of traditional Linux package managers and image-based deployments. It enables building OSTree operating system images from RPM packages and, optionally, adding RPM packages as an extension layer into an OSTree deployment.

Green Boot::

The Green Boot technology enables performing health checks at system boot and, if those checks detect any issue, rolling back the system to a previous system image. Green Boot ensures that system updates can be applied safely and reliably, without intervention from IT personnel in case of issues.

FIDO Device Onboard (FDO)::

The FDO standard enables installing secrets and configuration data into a device so that the device is able to connect and interact securely with cloud and edge management platforms and with central IT systems. RHEL for Edge supports many alternatives to FDO for performing local device and site configuration, such as Kickstart and ignition, but the FDO standard got strong traction in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) community and vendors.

Notice that the components of RHEL for Edge depend on each other, for example: Green Boot can only roll back a system update because RPM-OSTree keeps the previous OSTree image on disk, unchanged.

In this course, we focus on using the Image Builder and RPM-OSTree components of RHEL for Edge to deploy and update edge devices. Other courses will teach the use of Green Boot and FDO to automate system image rollback and device onboarding.

To understand how these components address the needs of edge devices, you must consider how edge devices differ from traditional office workstations and data center servers.

== What is an Edge Device

Edge devices, sometimes called edge endpoints, edge gateways, and edge servers, come in varying shapes and forms. Some of them  look like standard computers, maybe in a rugged and smaller form factory, which connect to varying kinds of sensors and machinery. They could also take unique form factors which integrate sensors, servo-mechanisms, and other kinds of machinery with an Intel or ARM computer in the same system board and might not look, from the outside, anything like a "personal computer", despite being built on the same fundamental architecture, processors, chipsets, and peripheral busses.

image::s1-devices-fig-2.svg[title="Illustrative images of edge devices and traditional computers"]

Some kinds of computers, such as mini-PCs, are blurring the line between what looks like a traditional computer and an edge device. They might be eligible for Red Hat Device Edge subscriptions, or might require another subscription which provides Red Hat Enterprise Linux, depending on their capacity and intended applications.

RHEL for Edge is designed to support devices which are close in hardware architecture to standard personal computers and servers. It benefits from the large ecosystem of software and hardware certified for RHEL and the fact that the economy of edge devices got to a point where a "standard computer" is cost-effective and brings a lot more flexibility and power than a custom processor and chipset design.

For example, you cannot run RHEL directly in a surveillance camera, even if many security cameras do indeed run Linux. But you could run RHEL in edge devices that monitor the video feed from a surveillance camera (or from multiple cameras) to detect potential security threats and fire an alarm to call security or the police.

A similar edge device could use a video camera to perform quality control in a factory, identifying defective pieces and reducing the need for human inspection, and also rerouting the defective pieces for either disposal or recycling without manual intervention.

Now imagine that the same edge device controls a robotic arm with a spray gun: instead of being programmed with a fixed path to paint only a few pieces known in advance, an edge device could adapt and optimize the paint process based on whatever piece it sees.

Each of the scenarios above requires some specialized hardware, but they are more about the application software which controls the hardware than about custom chips and peripherals. Having a common and standard foundation for that software, based on Red Hat Device Edge, reduces the development and maintenance effort.

There are many more potential scenarios for edge devices than we can describe here. Most times, edge devices co-exist with more traditional computers and applications on the same site. Edge devices usually connect to traditional computers in remote sites such as corporate headquarters or a regional distribution center. For more information on the applicability of RHEL for Edge and Red Hat Device Edge to different edge scenarios, we invite you to explore https://www.redhat.com/en/products/edge/hatville[HatVille, the miniature city where edge computing comes to life].

Another set of factors to consider in assessing your edge device use case is the infrastructure available on an edge site. Edge devices may exist by themselves, in a site where the owner has little control of anything, like a pick-up locker location or an ATM machine at a drugstore. But edge devices might exist in a location which has a server room, uninterruptible power supplies, and reasonable cooling, such as in a large department store.

The following table compares edge devices with more traditional computers to help you distinguish when you might have a case of RHEL for Edge versus a case for traditional RHEL. Parts of it may become quickly outdated as hardware evolves and costs come down, so instead of focusing on fixed numbers, focus on relative differences and check the https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/red-hat-enterprise-linux-subscription-guide[RHEL Subscription Guide] or ask your Red Hat Account Manager for pricing and eligibility for the many edge and non-edge product SKUs.

== Image-Based Versus Package-Based Systems

The main characteristic of RHEL for Edge, from the point of view of a Systems Administrator, is that it is an image-based system, while traditional RHEL is a package-based system.

image::s1-devices-fig-4.svg[title="Package-based RHEL versus image-based RHEL for Edge"]

You can use RHEL Image Builder to build both types of system images:

* Package-based system images based on RPM and DNF for traditional RHEL

* Image-based images based on RPM-OSTree for RHEL for Edge.

This course focuses on the second option.

An image-based system manages an entire operating system as a single system image. You do not install or update individual parts of the operating system, like you would do with package-based systems, using a package manager.

Package-based systems require extensive day-2 customizations to install additional packages and edit system configuration files. On the other side, with image-based systems it is expected that most day-2 customizations are already embedded in the system image. This is consistent with the shift-left approaches popular among DevOps and cloud-native practitioners.

The following table compares common actions for deploying and managing traditional RHEL, or package-based RHEL, with RHEL for Edge.

[options="header",cols="1,1"]  
|===
| RHEL for Edge
| Traditional RHEL

| Image-based, using the RPM-OSTree hybrid image and manager with OSTree system images and RPM packages.
| Package-based, using the DNF package manager with RPM packages.

| Either the RHEL installer or the CoreOS installer downloads and extracts a complete OSTree system image at once.
| The RHEL installer downloads and installs many RPM packages one by one.

| Download and deploy a complete OSTree system image, while retaining the previous system image unchanged. You end up keeping the previous system image or switching to the new system image.
| Update individual RPM packages using DNF. You might update some packages and not others, either on purpose, by mistake, or because some package updates could not be downloaded or applied.

| Eady to check the state of the entire system: it corresponds to one and only one of the available system images.
| Hard to track the state of a package-based system, as a whole: it could be in any permutation of the many packages and versions available.

| Install all operating system components and applications at once, as part of the system image.
| Install individual operating system components or applications one by one, from individual RPM packages and OCI container images.

| Embed operating system and application configuration files in the system image, and perform minimal local customization or edits, per-device or per-site, as a day-2 activity.
| Edit operating system and application configuration files one by one, as a day-2 activity (after deploying the operating system).

When you create a RHEL cloud instance, for example using the AMI or Qcow2 cloud images for RHEL, they deploy package-based RHEL, which you manage the same way as if you installed from the RHEL installation media. But, with RHEL for Edge, you can create cloud images which deploy image-based systems, even if your cloud instances are not cloud edge instances.

The RPM-OSTree technology allows you to add RPM packages to a system installed from an OSTree system image, but it enforces a clear separation between the contents from the system image and the packages (mostly applications) layered over the system image, similar to how Android and iOS devices deploy and update their operating systems independent of applications from the marketplace. Do not abuse this capability, or else you could lose track of the state of each individual edge device. It exists mostly for the development, testing, and troubleshooting of changes that will become part of the next system image.

RHEL for Edge can also consume applications as OCI container images, and update those container images from container registries. This is more manageable than RPM packages because there is an automatic rollback capability from Podman and Systemd, which is similar to Green Boot with OSTree updates. Anyway, it is usually preferable to include your application container images in the OSTree system image so you know the state of edge devices corresponds to a system image and nothing else.

When you think about customizations of an edge device, consider how much of it is actually per-device or per-site. You may find that many, if not most, of the day-2 customizations you're used to performing in package-based systems could be included in a system image. For example, the public key of your corporate certificate authority, for secure TLS communications, is a customization that applies to all your edge devices equally, in all sites. But the IP address of a web proxy is probably different for each site and multiple devices on the same site require the same web proxy configuration.

It is your option to build site-specific edge images, which embed customizations for each individual site, or build a single edge image for all edge sites, and apply the same configurations to multiple devices in the same location. In any case, you can use Ansible automation to apply or change site and device-specific customizations, similar to what you would do with traditional computers. You just expect to have fewer customizations to apply using automation, because more of them are already done in the system image.

== Next Steps

// Add links to previous headings on bootc, FDO, ostree, etc

Before learning about the operation of Image Builder and edge image types, you will assess your understanding of how edge sites differ from traditional corporate IT data centers and cloud IT.
