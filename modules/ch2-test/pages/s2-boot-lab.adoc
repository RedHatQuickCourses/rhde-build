= Lab: Boot Edge VMs from Remote OSTree Repostories

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Publish an Image Builder edge commit image in a remote HTTP server so it is available to edge devices.

WARNING: Work In Progress

== Before you Begin

You need a RHEL machine configured with the Image Builder service, its CLI and web UI, and a user that is member of the `weldr` group. Make sure your test machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-build:s4-install-lab.adoc[first lab].

You need a second machine to run a web server that serves OSTree repositories. Make sure that machine was configured and verified by following the instructions from xref:ch1-build:s7-ostree-lab.adoc[the previous lab].

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.4 [tentative!] but should work with minimal or no change on and newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course classroom, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`, and you start SSH sessions to the `servera` VM from the same user. If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment.

== Instructions

1. On your test machine, verify that you have the prerequisites from previous labs.

.. Verify that TBD

$ *composer-cli status show*
API server status:
    Database version:   0
    Database supported: true
    Schema version:     0
    API version:        1
    Backend:            osbuild-composer
    Build:              NEVRA:osbuild-composer-76-2.el9_2.x86_64
...
--

2. Install the libvirtd tools and its Cockpit module.

.. Install the "Virtualization Host" package group to get the libvirtd, KVM, and Qemu daemons and tools.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ sudo dnf group install -y "Virtualization Host"
--

.. Grant an unprivileged user with pemrission to create and manage virtual machines (MVs).
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ sudo groupmod libvirt -a -U student
--

3. Create a RHEL VM which boots from the RHEL installation ISO and fetches an edge commit image from a web server.
+
*UPDATE:* second attempt now works, thanks to fixes to kickstart (autopart --type=plain). Now to find out how to put that entry on the kickstart for the installer image... and if I still need those for RHEL 9.4 and later.

.. 1st attempt, from product docs.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ virt-install \
--name edge-test-1 \
--memory 2048 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk path=edge-test-1.qcow2,format=qcow2,size=8 \
--os-variant rhel9.0 \
--cdrom /home/student/Downloads/rhel-9.4-x86_64-boot.iso
--
+
Edit the kernel manually entry by appending:
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
inst.ks=http://servera.lab.example.com/rhel9-httpd.ks
--

.. 2nd attempt, from HOL007.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ virt-install \
--name edge-test-1 \
--memory 4096 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk size=40 \
--os-variant rhel9.2 \
--location /home/student/Downloads/rhel-9.4-x86_64-boot.iso \
--graphics=none \
--extra-args inst.ks=http://servera.lab.example.com/rhel9-httpd.ks \
--extra-arg console=ttyS0 -v
--
+
If I use --cdrom instead of --location I get: ERROR    Kernel arguments are only supported with location or kernel installs.

.. Both attempts at using a custom kickstart with an edge commit image result in VMs that, after reboot, stay forever on "A start job is running for…rhel-swap/rhel-boot".
+
They seem to deploy the ostree commit, from boot messages and the apache access log. I have no clue why they cannot finish installation. :-(

4. Cleaning up test VMs up between each attempt.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ virsh destroy edge-test-1
Domain 'edge-test-1' destroyed
$ virsh undefine edge-test-1
Domain 'edge-test-1' has been undefined
--

5. Create an edge installer image.

.. Create a blueprint for the edge installer image.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ cat rhel9-installer.toml 
name = "rhel9-installer"
description = "blueprint-rhel9-installer"
version = "0.0.1"
--
+
You can also downlod the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/blob/main/blueprints/rhel9-installer.toml[installer blueprint] from sample applications repository in GitHub.

.. Upload the blueprint to the Image Builder service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ composer-cli blueprints push rhel9-installer.toml 
$ composer-cli blueprints list
rhel9-edge
rhel9-installer
--

.. Build an edge installer using the blueprint you just uploaded, referring to the edge commit image that was published in a web server in a xref:ch1-build:s7-ostree-lab.adoc[previous lab].
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ composer-cli compose start-ostree rhel9-installer edge-installer --ref rhel/9/x86_64/edge --url http://servera.lab.example.com/repo/
Compose 7a5036e1-4037-4edc-82ff-4c632c0a84fc added to the queue
--

.. Wait until the compose finishes.

--

.. Download the edge installer image. You should get an ISO file.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ composer-cli compose image 7a5036e1-4037-4edc-82ff-4c632c0a84fc
7a5036e1-4037-4edc-82ff-4c632c0a84fc-installer.iso
--

6. Create a VM that boots from the edge installer image.

.. 1st attempt, it fails to process the kickstart embeded in the ISO. It should *not* display Anaconda screens for choosing packages, installation source, etc.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ virt-install \
--name edge-test-2 \
--memory 4096 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk size=40 \
--os-variant rhel9.2 \
--location /home/student/7a5036e1-4037-4edc-82ff-4c632c0a84fc-installer.iso \
--graphics=none \
--extra-arg console=ttyS0 -v
--

.. 2nd attempt, it kinda works, but doesn't work unattended, as it would be expected. It enters anaconda UI stating that the kickstart is unsufficient and asking to enter the "Installation Destination" screen. I enter and accept the defaults of automatic partitioning. Then I can begin installation, it seems to deploy the OSTree commit, and complete the installation. But after rebooting, it stays forever on "A start job is running for…rhel-swap/rhel-root"... just like the previous attempts. :-(
+
Exactly like it did with the previous attempts, using a custom kickstart with the standard RHEL ISO and a remote OSTree repository.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
virt-install \
--name edge-test-2 \
--memory 4096 \
--vcpus 2 \
--disk size=40 \
--os-variant rhel9.2 \
--cdrom /home/student/7a5036e1-4037-4edc-82ff-4c632c0a84fc-installer.iso
--

.. I verified the edge installer ISO, it looks good: I can see the osbuild.ks file, the grub menus that refer to iso, and the local copy of OSTree repository.

7. At this point, I have no clue why my edge images fail to finish installing/booting. What's different between my environment, besides not using the edge container image, compared to the HOL007?

.. HOL7 does not use the kickstart inside the edge installer image, it uses its own custom kickstart... which was the basis for the one I used on my first attemp. HOL007 is *not* using the OSTree repo from inside the ISO, so it should work the same with a standard RHEL installation ISO.

.. I refuse to accept it's something with libvirtd or nested virtualization: we run OpenShift Virtualization, OpenStack, and RHV in the same environment. Why couldn't image-based VMs using OSTree work? I'm more inclined to think there's either an issue with the kickstart files (including the one generated by Image Builder inside the edge installer image) or with my virt-install commands.

.. Would it be because I'm running VMs as an unprivileged user? I didn't try following the HOL007 instructions, which work on the same classroom, without sudo.
